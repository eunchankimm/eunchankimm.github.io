## 국내여행

**1) 좋아하는 국내여행 장소**

Korea has tons of beautiful and exciting beaches because korea is a peninsula.

One of my favorite beaches would have to be 해운대

It is in a coastal city called 부산

It is one of the most well-known beaches in korea.

It gets extremely crowded during the peak season.

so, this is what my favorite beach looks like.



**2) 어렸을 때 갔었던 여행 기억**  

I remember going to the beach with my family.

The beach of the name was 경포대.

The beach was one of the most well-known beaches in korea.

The coastline was very very scenic.

The sunset and the sunrise were breathtaking.

Looking back, It is one of the most 메모러벌 트립 in my life.

It was worth the money.



**2 - 2) 여행가기전에 하는 준비**

프랭클린 스피킹,

I don't prepare for the trip.
but I go to a trip with much money.
It is very convenient.

I think it is different for each person.



**3) 여행 중에 있었던 특이했던 에피소드**

I remember when I ate wrong food during a trip.

I ate some seafood that went bad.

my stomach was upset.

I had to see the doctof and got some medicine.

I took some medicine to get better and better.

so, I try to be more careful when it comes to eating.
